77781	helper called by generated code to construct default values for string fields . < p > the protocol compiler does not actually contain a utf - 8 decoder - - it just pushes utf - 8 - encoded text around without touching it . the one place where this presents a problem is when generating java string literals . unicode characters in the string literal would normally need to be encoded using a unicode escape sequence , which would require decoding them . to get around this , protoc instead embeds the utf - 8 bytes into the generated code and leaves it to the runtime library to decode them . < p > it gets worse , though . if protoc just generated a byte array , like : new byte [ ] { 0x12 , 0x34 , 0x56 , 0x78 } java actually generates * code * which allocates an array and then fills in each value . this is much less efficient than just embedding the bytes directly into the bytecode . to get around this , we need another work - around . string literals are embedded directly , so protoc actually generates a string literal corresponding to the bytes . the easiest way to do this is to use the iso - 8859 - 1 character set , which corresponds to the first 256 characters of the unicode range . protoc can then use good old cescape to generate the string . < p > so we have a string literal which represents a set of bytes which represents another string . this function - - stringdefaultvalue - - converts from the generated string to the string we actually want . the generated code calls this automatically .

30911	called by the lookuplistener ' s notify ( ) method . checks the event sequence number and , based on whether or not a " gap " is found in in the event sequence , creates and places on the queue , either a lookuptask ( if a gap was found ) or a notifytask . recall that the event specification states that if the sequence numbers of two successive events differ by only 1 , then one can be assured that no events were missed . on the other hand , if the difference is greater than 1 ( the sequence contains a " gap " ) , then one or more events may - - or may not - - have been missed . thus , if a gap is found in the events , although it ' s possible that no events were missed , this method takes the conservative approach by assuming events were missed . when this method determines that an event may have been missed , it requests a current " snapshot " of the given serviceregistrar ' s state by queueing the execution of a lookuptask . since this method can safely assume that no events have been missed if it finds no gaps in the event sequence , this method queues the notification of the entity by requesting the execution of a notifyeventtask . note that when a lookup service is discovered , this utility registers with that lookup service ' s event mechanism for service events related to the services of interest . upon registering with the event mechanism , a data structure ( of type eventreg ) containing information about that registration is placed in a map for later processing when events do arrive . if the timing is right , it is possible that a service event may arrive between the time the registration is made and the time the eventreg is stored in the map . thus , this method may find that the eventregmap does not contain an element corresponding to the event this method is currently processing . in that case , this method will do nothing . it will simply return so that the service referenced in the event can be discovered using the snapshot returned by the lookuptask that is ultimately queued by the registerlistenertask ( whose listener registration caused this method to be invoked in the first place ) .

48729	test the named character encoding to verify that it converts ascii characters correctly . we have to use an ascii based encoding , or else the networkclients will not work correctly in ebcdic based systems . however , we cannot just use ascii or iso8859_1 universally , because in asian locales , non - ascii characters may be embedded in otherwise ascii based protocols ( eg . http ) . the specifications ( rfc2616 , 2398 ) are a little ambiguous in this matter . for instance , rfc2398 [ part 2 . 1 ] says that the http request uri should be escaped using a defined mechanism , but there is no way to specify in the escaped string what the original character set is . it is not correct to assume that utf - 8 is always used ( as in urls in html 4 . 0 ) . for this reason , until the specifications are updated to deal with this issue more comprehensively , and more importantly , http servers are known to support these mechanisms , we will maintain the current behavior where it is possible to send non - ascii characters in their original unescaped form .

6367	main worker run loop . repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them , while coping with a number of issues : 1 . we may start out with an initial task , in which case we don ' t need to get the first one . otherwise , as long as pool is running , we get tasks from gettask . if it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters . other exits result from exception throws in external code , in which case completedabruptly holds , which usually leads processworkerexit to replace this thread . 2 . before running any task , the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing , and clearinterruptsfortaskrun called to ensure that unless pool is stopping , this thread does not have its interrupt set . 3 . each task run is preceded by a call to beforeexecute , which might throw an exception , in which case we cause thread to die ( breaking loop with completedabruptly true ) without processing the task . 4 . assuming beforeexecute completes normally , we run the task , gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterexecute . we separately handle runtimeexception , error ( both of which the specs guarantee that we trap ) and arbitrary throwables . because we cannot rethrow throwables within runnable . run , we wrap them within errors on the way out ( to the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler ) . any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die . 5 . after task . run completes , we call afterexecute , which may also throw an exception , which will also cause thread to die . according to jls sec 14 . 20 , this exception is the one that will be in effect even if task . run throws . the net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterexecute and the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code .

11455	v & h is a system of coordinates ( v and h ) for describing locations of rate centers in the united states . the projection , devised by j . k . donald , is an " elliptical , " or " doubly equidistant " projection , scaled down by a factor of 0 . 003 to balance errors . < p > the foci of the projection , from which distances are measured accurately ( except for the scale correction ) , are at 37d 42m 14 . 69s n , 82d 39m 15 . 27s w ( in floyd co . , ky . ) and 41d 02m 55 . 53s n , 112d 03m 39 . 35 w ( in webster co . , utah ) . they are just 0 . 4 radians apart . < p > here is the transformation from latitude and longitude to v & h : first project the earth from its ellipsoidal surface to a sphere . this alters the latitude ; the coefficients bi in the program are the coefficients of the polynomial approximation for the inverse transformation . ( the function is odd , so the coefficients are for the linear term , the cubic term , and so on . ) also subtract 52 degrees from the longitude . < p > for the rest , compute the arc distances of the given point to the reference points , and transform them to the coordinate system in which the line through the reference points is the x - axis and the origin is the eastern reference point . the solution is < p > h = ( square of distance to e - square of distance to w + square of distance between e and w ) / twice distance between e and w ; < br > v = square root of absolute value of ( square of distance to e - square of h ) . < p > reduce by three - tenths of a percent , rotate by 76 . 597497 degrees , and add 6363 . 235 to v and 2250 . 7 to h . < p > to go the other way , as this program does , undo the final translation , rotation , and scaling . the z - value pz of the point on the x - y - z sphere satisfies the quadratic azz + bz + c = 0 , where < p > a = ( exwz - ezwx ) ^ 2 + ( eywzx - ezwy ) ^ 2 + ( exwy - eywx ) ^ 2 ; < br > b = - 2 [ ( ex cos ( arc to w ) - wx cos ( arc to e ) ) ( exwz - ezwx ) - ( ey cos ( arc to w ) - wy cos ( arc to e ) ) ( eywz - ezwy ) ] ; < br > c = ( ex cos ( arc to w ) - wx cos ( arc to e ) ) ^ 2 + ( ey cos ( arc to w ) - wy cos ( arc to e ) ) ^ 2 - ( exwy - eywx ) ^ 2 . < p > solve with the quadratic formula . the latitude is simply the arc sine of pz . px and py satisfy < p > expx + eypy + ezpz = cos ( arc to e ) ; < br > wxpx + wypy + wzpz = cos ( arc to w ) . < p > substitute pz ' s value , and solve linearly to get px and py . the longitude is the arc tangent of px / py . finally , this latitude and longitude are spherical ; use the inverse polynomial approximation on the latitude to get the ellipsoidal earth latitude , and add 52 degrees to the longitude .

60725	returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base - level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base - level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side - effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n ' s next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b ' s current successor , which means that we don ' t have a consistent 3 - node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n ' s value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn ' t require restart , they aren ' t sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n ' s predecessor ' s value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we can ' t unlink the node because we don ' t know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b . value check isn ' t strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they can ' t easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed .
